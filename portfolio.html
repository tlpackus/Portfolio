  <h3>About Me</h3>

  <p>I'm a young artis. Always trying to create new things and find new challenges to grow my mind and presence in this world. I've been self educating exessively since high school. Here are some examples.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Music-</strong> Practice guitar, drums, vocals, lyrics, and beat engineering through Logic x and Reaper</li>
      <li><strong>Pyrography-</strong> I practice realism art, and use a torch pen to burn it into any wood</li>
      <li><strong>Sales-</strong> Money has never came easy. I began learning the art of the sale since age 11 at the Portland Saturday Martket selling hand made copper art. I havent stopped since and always ready to help make a sale</li>
      <li><strong>Programming</strong> I still am learning this one but my main goal is to help other artist and small buisness owners reach global audiences opposed to just local. By building them solid websites to showcase their work and bring up sales. Making us both more money and hopefully an asset for both of us. </li>
    </ul>
