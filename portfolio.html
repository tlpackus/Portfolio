    <h3><span class="high">About</span> <span class="highlight">Me</span></h3>

    <p>I'm a knowledge seaker. Always looking for new challenges to grow my mind and capability in this world. School was helpful but the one size fits all learning style was not for me. I took to getting a job and self educating on my own as soon as I could. I got into hobbies such as music, pyrography, sales and programming. Let me expand on that below...</p>
  </div>
  <div class="interests">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Music-</strong> Learned from YouTube videos, friends, and books how to play guitar and drums. I also learned to engineer beats through a little Logic x and Reaper but mostly GarageBand.</li>
      <li><strong>Pyrography-</strong> I practice realism art. Using a torch pen I burn almost tattoo like images onto any wood.</li>
      <li><strong>Sales-</strong> I began working at age 11 at the Portland Saturday Market selling <em>handmade</em> copper art. I really enjoyed taking things of lesser value, finding a way to combine them into something of higher value and seeing them to customers that appreciate them. Thus got into studying sales from an early age. </li>
      <li><strong>Programming</strong> My main goal is to help artists and small buisness owners to reach global audiences, opposed to just local. I hope to build them solid websites to showcase their work and bring up their sales. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>I also had some cool jobs that don't particularly relate to the tech industry. I still learned a lot from them, so took note of them too if you're interested:
  <ol>
    <li>Regal Hilltop 9 Movie Theater's Floor Staff</li>
    <li>Milwaukee Lumber Customer Service Rep.</li>
    <li>Orchid Orthopedics Part Finisher</li>
    <li>Nekter Juice Bar Assistant Manager</li>
  </ol>

  <p> Thanks for checking out my portfolio!</p>
