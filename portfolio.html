    </ul>
     direction. programer with a lot to learn. I started My first coding bootcamp on January 4th, 2021. So far I've learned a lot of usefull information. The difficulty for me was remembering it all. After creating a new note taking system and going back over my lessons. I have developed a much better understanding of them. This Portfolio is a prime example.
